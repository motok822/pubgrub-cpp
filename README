## Building and Testing

### Run Tests

First, generate test data:

```bash
python generate_test.py
```

Then build and run the test:

```bash
cd tests
make test_loader
```

## Test Results

### Performance Comparison

Latest benchmark results comparing Naive vs PubGrub Solver implementations:

```
========================================
Results
========================================
Solution package count: 3050

Performance timing (microseconds)
  Naive:    1982087 us (packages=3050)
  Solver:   1566088 us (packages=3050)
  Speedup:  1.26563x (naive/solver)
  *** PubGrub solver is 1.26563x FASTER! ***
```

The PubGrub solver demonstrates a **1.27x speedup** over the naive implementation when resolving 3050 packages.
